# Github Repository: Prompt Engineering Notes and POCs
## Description
Welcome to the repository for 'Prompt Engineering Notes and POCs'! This repository is dedicated to the advancement of the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) with a specific focus on the development, research, and dissemination of knowledge related to prompt engineering and proof of concepts (POCs). This repository aims to improve the communication between human and AI models, provide clear and reliable sources for learning, and demonstrate new ways to use AI.

Here, you'll find detailed notes on prompt engineering techniques, encompassing a wide variety of methods to guide machine learning models towards desired outcomes. Additionally, POCs are developed to validate concepts or theories that further improve the field of prompt engineering. The POCs not only serve as a practical testing ground for these theories but also function as learning tools for those new to the field.
